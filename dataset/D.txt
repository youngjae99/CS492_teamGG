A: Do you realize what time it is?
B: I'm sorry, I lost track of time.
A: Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse?
B: Not at all--that is what really happened.
A: How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late?
B: Yes, I know. I must've forgot.
A: That's beside the point, you still should have called.
B: You're right. I'm sorry.
A: Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone.
B: You're really going to kick me out?
A: Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules.
B: Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore.
